# lncRNA_2way
Prediction of conserved plant long non-coding RNAs between two species

lncRNA_2way is a pipeline to predict conserved long non-coding RNAs between two plant species. 

Scripts here are customrized for rice and maize (resources from phytozome.net). Changes might be required when applied to other species or resources.

Please follow steps in Makefile to run the pipepline. Example dataset was provided in test directory.
